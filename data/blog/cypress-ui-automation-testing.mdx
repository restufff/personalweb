## About The Project

In this portfolio, I've developed Cypress UI automation testing integrated with Mochawesome for reporting. The web application under automation is [Flip](https://flip.id/en/landing). Key functionalities covered include:

1. **Language Toggle**: Implemented a language toggle at the top right corner, allowing users to switch between languages (ID and EN). Verification ensures the correct language is displayed after toggling.

2. **Cellular Providers Check**: Automated scrolling through the homepage to verify the presence of cellular providers supported by Flip. Ensured that Telkomsel, Indosat Ooredoo, and XL are mentioned among the supported providers.

3. **Money Transfer Service**: Navigated to Flip's money transfer service page from the homepage menu. Conducted a simulation of sending money to Poundsterling. Validation was performed to ensure the accuracy of the calculation based on the exchange rate and service fee.

These automation tests enhance the reliability and quality assurance of Flip's web application, ensuring seamless user experience and accurate functionality across different scenarios.
