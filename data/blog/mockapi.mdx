## Purpose

So this is the first time I was using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Mock API](https://mockapi.io/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This site currently working on dekstop Full HD resolution cause I dont get the full design of the page, you can check the design file here [Covid-19 Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/file/geeLpeMmmOZDzaHPjKgLP6/Covid-19-Landing-Page-For-Figma?node-id=1%3A2606)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
